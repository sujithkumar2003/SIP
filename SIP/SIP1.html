      <h2>Harmful Effects of Soil Degradation</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Soil degradation refers to the deterioration in the quality and health of soil due to various human activities and natural processes. It is a significant environmental problem that can have numerous harmful effects on ecosystems, agriculture, and human well-being. Some of the key harmful effects of soil degradation include:</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>DESERTIFICATION</p>
          <img src="desertification.jpg" alt="Effect 1">
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Desertification: Soil degradation can contribute to the expansion of arid and semi-arid regions, leading to desertification. Desertification makes it difficult for plant life to thrive, displaces local communities, and leads to the loss of biodiversity.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>EROSION</p>
          <img src="5906.jpg" alt="Effect 2">
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Erosion: Degraded soil is more susceptible to erosion by wind and water. This leads to the loss of topsoil, which contains essential nutrients and organic matter, further reducing the soil's productivity.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>BIO DIVERSITY LOSS</p>
          <img src="biodiversity_loss.jpg" alt="Effect 3">
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Loss of biodiversity: Healthy soil supports a diverse range of plant and animal species. Soil degradation can disrupt this balance, leading to a decline in biodiversity and the loss of important ecosystem services.</p>

      <h2>Prevention Measures</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Preventing soil degradation is essential for maintaining healthy ecosystems, sustainable agriculture, and preserving the environment. Here are some effective strategies to prevent soil degradation:</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>CONSERVATION TILLAGE</p>
          <img src="conservation_tillage.jpg" alt="Measure 1">
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Conservation tillage: Implement conservation tillage practices, such as no-till or reduced tillage, to minimize soil disturbance. These methods help retain organic matter, reduce erosion, and preserve soil structure and nutrients.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>CROP ROTATION</p>
          <img src="crop rotation.jpg" alt="Measure 2">
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Crop rotation and diversification: Practice crop rotation and grow a diverse range of crops in a particular area. Different plants have different nutrient requirements, and rotating crops helps maintain soil fertility and reduces the risk of nutrient depletion.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>WIND BREAKS</p>
          <img src="wind_breaks.jpg" alt="Measure 3">
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Windbreaks: Plant windbreaks of trees or shrubs to protect soil from wind erosion, especially in open and exposed areas.</p>
        </li>
